How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could compare code side by side, which makes it easier to spot changes and possible bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could go back in my history to use a piece of code that works before but not now. It also helps others to see how you built you code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are that there are much better save points. The cons is that auto saving helps when you forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think it is so that you never forget to save a file at any point.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use them to figure out where changes were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You are able to take risks that my scare you because you can go back versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All my projects.
